There once was a boy named Karam who wanted to sail the seas as a pirate.
Karam and his family lived in Northern Africa during the early 1400s when 
technological advances were few and chaos was abundant. However, Karam lived 
for the unpredictable. He'd try his best to pretend to be a pirate by doing 
things like putting eye makeup on, wearing raggedy clothes, and yelling "argh" 
when he could. Karam's parents think he's going through a phase, but Karam 
truly believes he will be a pirate when he grows up.
