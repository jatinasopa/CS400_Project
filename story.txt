There was once a little boy called Harry whose dream was to have his very own pirate ship and sail around the seas;
finding treasure that had been lost a long, long time ago. Harry always spent his weekends with his Grandma and Granddad; 
his Mummy would drop him off every Saturday morning at 9 o’clock on the dot and pick him back up on Sundays at 6 o’clock just after tea time.
Grandma and Granddad’s house was a big old farm house with a big garden and was next to a meadow full of lovely flowers. 
At the bottom of the garden stood Granddad’s workshop and an old shed.
